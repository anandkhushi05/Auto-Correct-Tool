Auto Correct Tool

Welcome to the Auto Correct Tool repository! ‚ú®üìù

This project aims to provide an automated solution for correcting spelling and grammatical errors in text documents. The tool uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to identify and suggest corrections for words and phrases that may have been mistyped or written incorrectly.

Features:
- Corrects common spelling mistakes and typos in text documents.
- Provides a user-friendly command-line interface for easy usage.

How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary libraries.
3. Run the auto correct tool using jupyter notebook.

Contributions:
I welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and accuracy of the auto correct tool. If you have ideas for improving the correction algorithms, adding new languages, or refining the user interface, please consider submitting pull requests.

Future Enhancements:
- Incorporate machine learning techniques for context-aware corrections.
- Develop a web-based interface for users to correct text online.
- Integrate with popular text editors for real-time correction suggestions.
- Expand language support to include less commonly spoken languages.

Your feedback is essential for the growth of this tool. Let's work together to make written communication more accurate and polished! üìöüåê
